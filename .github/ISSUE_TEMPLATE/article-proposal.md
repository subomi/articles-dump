## Working Title

> Example:
> A Rubyist's Guide to Database Transactions

## Briefly describe the article

> Example:
> Database transactions can be intimidating, but they're super important in many common use-cases. This article will teach rubyists everything they need to know about transactions, from the DB level through active record and larger architectural concerns.

## List 4-6 main topics

> Example:
>
> - What are transactions?
> - When should you use them?
> - How to use them in raw SQL
> - How to use them in Rails
> - Pitfalls to watch out for.

## Describe the audience as specifically as possible

> Example:
> Intermediate ruby developers working with DBs in Rails

## What value does it provide them?

> Example:
> This article will teach them how to maintain their DB's integrity during complex updates that have to be correct - such as when dealing with currency.

## What do you hope will make this article special / unique / attention-getting?

> Example:
> While lots of articles cover one aspect of DB transactions, this article covers all of them in one place. A reader could begin reading knowing noting about them, and will leave knowing how and when to use them in production.
