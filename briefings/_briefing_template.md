  * A curated list of new content (like the ruby weekly newsletter

  An individual author writing posts on their blog is not a source.

## Events

<!--
  Events are any public gathering (virtual or in person) that is mentioned in your sources. They include conferences, meetups, etc.

  For each event mentioned in your sources, add a list item like the one below. Include all major events. You can skip small meetups. From 0 to 5 events is typical.

  Place events with the most news (or the most important news) at the top of the list.

  EVENT NAME: The name of the event

  EVENT URL: The event's website. If there's no website, put a url where we can learn more.

  An event like Railsconf will create a steady trickle of news items leading up to its date.

  For each of these news items, add a line like the ones below. The date is the publication date. The news item should contain a 1-2 sentence description and a link to more information.

  If you find multiple news items about identical news, only add the one that seems best to you.

  List the items with the newest first. i.e. reverse chronological order.

  DATE: The date of the news item, formatted like "Jan 1", "Feb 20", etc. Don't include the year.

## Security
<!--

  Here, we link to CVE reports for any vulnerabilities that have been reported for the language and its major libraries.
  You can find these by searching for language/framework names here: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html

  List every CVE report you can find that was published this quarter. A typical number is 1 to 5.

  If you can find an easier way to source this info (like a language-specific security mailing lis) feel free to use it.

  DATE: The date of the news item, formatted like "Jan 1", "Feb 20", etc. Don't include the year.

## Projects

<!--
  What is an project? They include:
  * Important open source projects like Rails
  * Organizations like Girls Who Code
  * Any group of people doing a thing that isn't an event.

  For each project mentioned in your sources, add a list item like the one below. A typical number of projects is 5ish.

  It's up to you to decide what is an "important" open source project. If it seems like it has a community around it and you've heard of it before it's probably important.

  Place projects with the most news (or the most important news) at the top of the list.

## Trending Topics

  Identify 3-5 of these trends and create entries like the one below for each.

  TOPIC TITLE: Make one up

  COUNT: The number of articles, twitter threads,  etc. you saw discussing the topic. We just want an approximation. Don't spend more than a minute counting.

  DESCRIPTION: 2-3 sentences explaining the topic

  Review each piece of content related to the trend. Select 2-3 that give a well-rounded overview of the trend.
