# Briefings Overview for Authors

In addition to blog posts, we create 'briefings' which summarize the new around a particular programming language for the quarter.

If you are interested in writing briefings for us, please open an issue on your repo (use the question template) and let us know.

## Process

Here's how the briefing process works.

1. We’ll give you a list of news and content sources.
2. We’ll give you a template briefing and some guidance
3. You’ll read through the sources, and use the template to create the briefing.

## 1. The sources

Go to our lists of [newsletters](https://www.notion.so/honeybadger/e10abb4268564c7cafca2c1fca603240?v=d32869671a7d4d60847174b9d3c2f809) and [subreddits](https://www.notion.so/honeybadger/138d642027e14efeb37f7dd17aa0eea1?v=5a874650102648dab2156e7198edec35) that are tagged with your topic. These will be your initial sources. You can use your own sources in addition to these, if you like.

We want you to comb through these sources for the past quarter. If there are limitations on how far back you can look (like with reddit) don’t worry about it.

## 2. The template

We use a template for these briefings. You’ll just fill it in. It saves everyone time.

The template is located in the `briefings/_briefing_template.md` . Please create a copy and name it something like `briefings/2021-Q1-python.md`. That's `YEAR-QUARTER-LANGUAGE.md`.

Detailed instructions are included in the template itself. Just view the source, and you’ll see them in the comments.

I’ve also made a [screencast to walk you through it](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d0qvvqj2wc67ipc/template-walkthrough-5-19-21.mov?dl=0).

If anything is unclear, please comment on this issue, and we’ll help you.

## 3. Creating the briefing

This part is up to you. Here are a few notes:

- Your audience is a Sr. developer who is not an expert in this language. Please be sure to define terms that may be unfamiliar to them.
- Please remember this is a summary of the quarter, not a catalogue of it. One reason we’re hiring you is to figure out what’s important and what’s not.
- None of this should be grueling. If you find yourself stuck, or shaving yaks, get in touch and we’ll help figure it out.
