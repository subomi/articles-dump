# Understanding Rbenv, RubyGems, and Bundler

Managing dependencies in Ruby usually involves specifying the Ruby and gem versions on which our project relies. In my experience working with Ruby, debugging dependencies has been one of my biggest challenges. Failures aren't common because many things "just work"; however, when things go wrong, they're usually unnecessarily difficult to debug and fix. In this article, I will lay out the pieces involved in dependency management in Ruby. This will assist in debugging these strange issues when they occur.

### Ruby Code Loading

By default, the Ruby language provides two major methods for loading code defined elsewhere: `load` & `require`. 

```ruby
load 'json.rb'
require 'json.rb'
require_relative 'json.rb'
```

Both loading methods accept both absolute and relative paths as arguments. However, there are two differentiating factors:

1. Multiple calls to `load` will re-execute the file, whereas multiple calls to `require` will not re-execute the file; instead, it will return `false`.
2. Calls to `load` resolves only to absolute and relative paths. Calls to `require` checks up on the `$LOAD_PATH` when the path doesn't resolve to an absolute path.

A third variant is `require_relative`, which uses relative paths to require code relative to the current file’s location rather than the Ruby process’ working directory.

## Rbenv

A version manager is a tool used to manage and easily switch between versions of our interpreter (in this case, Ruby) and specify the location to find respective gems for our project. Version managers are largely language agnostic tools, and various languages have their respective implementations, such as [Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [n](https://github.com/tj/n) for Node.js, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python, and [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), [rvm](https://rvm.io), and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) for Ruby. Now, let's take `rbenv` for a spin, shall we? 

### Install Ruby Version

We use the command `rbenv install` to install any version of Ruby:

```bash

```

### Switch Between Versions

There are a number of ways to identify how to switch between versions of Ruby; invariably, `rbenv` does the following:

- Checks the `RBENV_VERSION`.
- Searches for a `.ruby-version` file in the script's directory and its parent until it hits the root directory.
- Searches for a `.ruby-version` file in `$PWD` and its parent directories until it hits the root directory.
- Uses the global file `~/.rbenv/version`.

The priority goes from top to bottom.  `~/.rbenv/version` is the final fallback and treated as the global version. See below:

```ruby
# Inside First Project Root 

# Select ruby version for project
$ touch .ruby-version && echo "2.7.1" >> .ruby-version

# Verify selected version
$ ruby --version 
ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x86_64-darwin20] # Result

$ rbenv version
2.7.1 (set by /path/to/current/directory/.ruby-version) # Result

# Change selected version
$ : >> .ruby-version && echo "2.6.1" >> .ruby-version

# Verify selection change
$ ruby --version 
ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-darwin20] # Result

$ rbenv version 
2.6.1 (set by /path/to/current/directory/.ruby-version)

# Change selection with RBENV_VERSION while .ruby-version is present
$ export RBENV_VERSION=2.5.1

# Verify selection change
# .ruby-version is ignored.
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.5.1p57 (2018-03-29 revision 63029) [x86_64-darwin20] # Result

$ rbenv version
2.5.1 (set by RBENV_VERSION environment variable) # Result

# Change to a version that is not installed & remove RBENV_VERSION
$ unset RBENV_VERSION & : >> .ruby-version && echo "2.4.1" >> .ruby-version 

# Verify selection change
$ ruby --version
rbenv: version `2.4.1' is not installed (set by full/path/to/current/directory/.ruby-version) # Result
```

### Shims and Rehashing

These two concepts need to be properly understood to be able to debug `rbenv` effectively. 

- **Shims.** These ****are lightweight bash scripts that exist in your `PATH` to intercept commands and route them to the appropriate version for execution. On a high level, every command (e.g., `rspec`) is translated into `rbenv exec rspec`. See the details below.
    - First, `rbenv` creates a shim for all commands (`rspec`, `bundle`, etc.) across all installed Ruby versions to intercept calls to the CLI regardless of the version. These shims can be found at `~/.rbenv/shims`. Every shim contains the same bash script, as shown below:

        ```bash
         #!/usr/bin/env bash
         1 set -e
         2 [ -n "$RBENV_DEBUG" ] && set -x
         3  
         4 program="${0##*/}"
         5 if [ "$program" = "ruby" ]; then
         6    for arg; do
         7      case "$arg" in
         8      -e* | -- ) break ;;
         9      */* )
         10        if [ -f "$arg" ]; then
         11         export RBENV_DIR="${arg%/*}"
         12         break
         13       fi
         14       ;;
         15     esac
         16   done
         17 fi
         18 
         19 export RBENV_ROOT="/home/directory/.rbenv"
         20 exec "/usr/local/Cellar/rbenv/1.1.2/libexec/rbenv" exec "$program" "$@"
        ```

    - Second, the script above roughly translates to the following:
        - If the program name is `ruby` with an argument `-e`,
            - Translate to `rbenv exec ruby <args>`
        - If the program name is `ruby` with a path to a script,
            - Set the `RBENV_DIR` to the the script's directory. This enables `rbenv` to search for `.ruby-version` in the script's directory before the `$PWD`. If a `.ruby-version` is specified in both locations, `rbenv` selects the script's directory.
        - If the program name is not Ruby,
            - Translate to `rbenv exec <program-name> <args>`.
    - Finally, `rbenv exec <command-name> <args>` identifies the correct version to pass the command to by checking the `RBENV_VERSION` environment variable. Remember, `RBENV_VERSION` is set by the algorithm defined above.

    **Caveat.** Shims on your `PATH` must be prepended; this ensures they're the first point of contact for your Ruby executables and can properly intercept. The best way I found to understand your `PATH` setup and know whether your shims are intercepting properly is as follows: 

    ```ruby
    # bash
    $ which -a bundle

    # Output
    /path/to/home/.rbenv/shims/bundle
    /usr/bin/bundle
    ```

    `which -a bundle`: this naively looks through your `PATH` and prints out in the order which it is found, locations where `bundle` can be found. If something is printed before anything in `~/.rbenv/shims`, it means your shims aren’t set up properly. `rbenv which bundle` won't reveal this because the command works in the context of `rbenv` not searching your `PATH`.

- **Rehashing.** This is the process of creating shims. When you newly install a Ruby gem that provides an executable, such as `rspec`, you need to run `rbenv rehash` to create the shim so that subsequent calls to `rspec` can be intercepted by `rbenv` and passed on to the appropriate Ruby version.

### RubyGems

Next is RubyGems. It is available from the official Ruby site. RubyGems is a Ruby packaging system designed to facilitate the creation, sharing, and installation of libraries; in some ways, it is a distribution packaging system similar to, say, apt-get, but targeted at Ruby software. RubyGems is the de-facto method for sharing gems. They are usually installed at  `~/.rbenv/versions/{version-number}/lib/ruby/gems/{minor-version}/`, or its variant, depending on which version manager is used. Ruby's default required method `Kernel.require` doesn't provide any mechanism to load gems from the Gems installation directory. RubyGems monkey-patches `Kernel.require` to 

- First, search for gems in the `$LOAD_PATH`.
- If not found, search for gems in the `GEMS INSTALLATION DIRECTORY`.
    - Once found, add the path to `$LOAD_PATH`.

This works "natively" because Ruby has come with RubyGems by default since version 1.9; previous Ruby versions required RubyGems to be installed manually. Although this works natively, it is also important to know this difference when debugging.

A gem is a bunch of related code used to solve a specific problem. Install a gem and get information about the gem environment as follows: 

```bash
$ gem install gemname
```

```bash
$ gem env

# Output
RubyGems Environment:

	- REMOTE SOURCES:     
		- https://rubygems.org/  
	- SHELL PATH:

```

How does RubyGems solve this problem? It monkey patches the `Kernel`'s require system with its own `require` method. With this in-place, when `require honeybadger` is called, it searches through the gems folder for `honeybadger.rb` and activates the gem when found. 

- For example, `require 'honeybadger'` produces something similar to the following:
    - `spec = Gem::Specification.find_by_path('honeybadger')`
    - `spec.activate`

Activating a gem simply means putting it in the `$LOAD_PATH`. RubyGems also helps download all of a gem’s dependencies before downloading the gem itself.  

Also, Rubygems ships with a nice feature that enables you to open the associated gem's directory with `gem open <gem-name>`; for example,

![Open demo](gem-open-demo.gif)

This allows us to easily find/trace the specific version of the gem our app is referencing. 

### Bundler

At this layer, Bundler helps us easily specify all our project dependencies and optionally specify a version for each. Then, it resolves our gems, as well as installs it and its dependencies. Building real-world applications pre-bundler came with a myriad of challenges, such as the following:

- Our applications exist with numerous dependencies, and these dependencies have various other dependencies and their respective versions. Installing the wrong version of one gem will easily break our app, and fixing this problem involved lots of tears.
- Also, two(2) of our dependencies can refer to the same third-level dependency. Finding compatibility was an issue, and if there was any, it was a problem.
- Where we have multiple applications on the same machine, with various dependencies, our application can access any gems installed on the machine, which goes against the principle of [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and exposes our application to all gems installed on the machine, regardless of whether they’re malicious.

Bundler solves all three problems and gives us a sane way to manage our app dependencies by doing the following.

- Bundler resolves dependencies and generates a lockfile:

    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    gem 'httparty'
    ```

    If we run `bundle` or `bundle install`, it will generate the lockfile: 

    ```ruby
    GEM
      specs:
        httparty (0.18.1)
          mime-types (~> 3.0)
          multi_xml (>= 0.5.2)
        mime-types (3.3.1)
          mime-types-data (~> 3.2015)
        mime-types-data (3.2020.1104)
        multi_xml (0.6.0)

    PLATFORMS
      ruby

    DEPENDENCIES
      httparty

    BUNDLED WITH
       2.1.4
    ```

    From the above, the bundler generates the version of `httparty` to be installed, as well as its own dependencies in the `Gemfile.lock.` This file is the blueprint of our app dependencies and should be checked into version control. It ensures that our project dependencies are consistent across environments (development, staging, or production). 

- Bundler resolves compatibility among dependencies

    It resolves the dependencies for `httparty` by finding a suitable version for its dependencies and specifying them. Bundler also tries to resolve dependencies between gems. For example,

    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    gem 'httparty' # That relies on gem 'mime-types', '>= 3.0.1, < 4.0.1'
    gem 'rest-client' # That relies on gem 'mime-types', '>= 2.0.1, < 3.0'
    ```

    The example above is arbitrary and will result in an error, such as the following: 

    ```ruby
    Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "mime-types":
    In Gemfile:
    	httparty was resolved to 0.18.1, which depends on 
    		mime-types ('>= 3.0.1, < 4.0.1')

    	rest-client was resolved to 2.0.4, which depends on 
    		mime-types ('>= 2.0.1, < 3.0')
    ```

    This is because two gems have dependencies that are not compatible and cannot be automatically resolved. 

- Bundler restricts access to gems installed but not specified in our `Gemfile`. In a sample gemfile like the following,

    ```ruby
    # Gemfile
    gem 'httparty'

    # irb
    require 'rest-client'

    # raises
    LoadError (cannot load such file -- rest-client)
    ```

    it ensures that only the dependencies specified in our `Gemfile` can be required by our project.

- Bundle exec

    When you run `rspec` in a project directory, there is a possibility of running a different version other than what was specified in the `Gemfile`. This is because the most recent version will be selected to run versus the version specified in the `Gemfile`. `bundle exec rspec` ensures `rspec` is run in the context of that project (i.e., The gems specified in the Gemfile).

- Bundle binstubs

    Often, we read articles where we run commands like `./bin/rails`; this command is similar to `bundle exec rails`. Binstubs are wrappers around Ruby executables to ease the usage of `bundle exec`. 

    - To generate a binstub run, use `bundle binstubs gem-name`. This creates a binstub in the `./bin` folder but can be configured with the `--path` directory if set.
